### output for problem_1
Here are 5 unique formal specifications as Python assertions for the `numerical_letter_grade` method, where `n` is the input list of floats and `res` is the expected return value (list of strings):


1.  **Assertion 1: Output list length and element types.**
   The output list `res` must have the same length as the input list `n`, and every element in `res` must be a string.
   ```python
   assert len(res) == len(n) and all(isinstance(grade, str) for grade in res)
   ```


2.  **Assertion 2: Specific mapping for the highest exact GPA.**
   If any GPA in the input list `n` is exactly 4.0, its corresponding grade in `res` must be 'A+'.
   ```python
   assert all(res[i] == 'A+' for i in range(len(n)) if n[i] == 4.0)
   ```


3.  **Assertion 3: Specific mapping for a typical mid-range GPA interval.**
   If a GPA is strictly greater than 2.7 and less than or equal to 3.0, its corresponding letter grade must be 'B'. This demonstrates correct handling of open and closed bounds.
   ```python
   assert all(res[i] == 'B' for i in range(len(n)) if 2.7 < n[i] <= 3.0)
   ```


4.  **Assertion 4: Specific mapping for the lowest exact GPA.**
   If any GPA in the input list `n` is exactly 0.0, its corresponding grade in `res` must be 'E'.
   ```python
   assert all(res[i] == 'E' for i in range(len(n)) if n[i] == 0.0)
   ```


5.  **Assertion 5: Comprehensive check for a broad range of high-tier grades.**
   For any GPA strictly greater than 2.7, its corresponding grade must correctly map to 'A+', 'A', 'A-', 'B+', or 'B' according to the specified rules. This assertion checks multiple interconnected grading rules.
   ```python
   assert all(
      (n[i] == 4.0 and res[i] == 'A+') or
      (3.7 < n[i] < 4.0 and res[i] == 'A') or
      (3.3 < n[i] <= 3.7 and res[i] == 'A-') or
      (3.0 < n[i] <= 3.3 and res[i] == 'B+') or
      (2.7 < n[i] <= 3.0 and res[i] == 'B')
      for i in range(len(n)) if n[i] > 2.7
   )
   ```
