We can calculate the Levenshtein distance between the two given strings and store it in a variable.\n4. We can then calculate the number of rotations required by subtracting the Levenshtein distance from the length of the first string.\n5. We can return the calculated number of rotations as the result of the function.\n\nPython:\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(str1, str2):\n    # Calculate the Levenshtein distance between the two strings\n    lev_dist = levenshtein(str1, str2)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of rotations required\n    rot_count = len(str1) - lev_dist\n    \n    # Return the number of rotations\n    return rot_count\n\ndef levenshtein(str1, str2):\n    # Calculate the Levenshtein distance between two strings using dynamic programming\n    size_x = len(str1) + 1\n    size_y = len(str2) + 1\n    matrix = [[0 for _ in range(size_y)] for _ in range(size_x)]\n    \n    for x in range(size_x):\n        matrix[x][0] = x\n    for y in range(size_y):\n        matrix[0][y] = y\n    \n    for x in range(1, size_x):\n        for y in range(1, size_y):\n            if str1[x-1] == str2[y-1]:\n                matrix[x][y] = min(\n                    matrix[x-1][y] + 1,\n                    matrix[x-1][y-1],\n                    matrix[x][y-1] + 1\n                )\n            else:\n                matrix[x][y] = min(\n                    matrix[x-1][y] + 1,\n                    matrix[x-1][y-1] + 1,\n                    matrix",

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach.\n3. We will create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of rotations required to get the string from index i to j.\n4. We will initialize the first row and the first column of the dp array.\n5. Then, we will fill up the rest of the dp array using the following relation: dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + 1) for every i >= j and dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + 1) for every i < j.\n6.
