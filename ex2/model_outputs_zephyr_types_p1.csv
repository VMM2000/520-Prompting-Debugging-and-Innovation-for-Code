2,"Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.

Write a Python function named `similar_elements` that solves the problem.
The function requires 2 input parameters of type tuple of int and 1 return values of type tuple of intUse a chain of thought to explain the solution before giving the code.

The similar elements can be defined as the elements that are present in both lists with the same frequency.\n3. To solve this problem, we can use the `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of elements in both lists.\n4. Then, we can compare the frequencies of elements in both lists to find the similar elements.\n5. Finally, we can return the similar elements as a tuple.\n\nPython:","from collections import Counter\n\ndef similar_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Count the frequency of elements in both lists\n    counter1 = Counter(list1)\n    counter2 = Counter(list2)\n    \n    # Compare the frequencies of elements in both lists\n    similar_elements = [(key, value1, value2) for key, value1 in counter1.items() if value1 == value2 and key in counter2]\n    \n    return similar_elements"
