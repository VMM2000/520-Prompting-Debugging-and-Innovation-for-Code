2,"Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.

Write a Python function named `similar_elements` that solves the problem.
The function requires 2 input parameters of type tuple of int and 1 return values of type tuple of intUse a chain of thought to explain the solution before giving the code.

The function should compare the elements of list1 and list2 to find the similar elements.\n3. We can use a nested loop to compare each element of list1 and list2.\n4. If a similar element is found, we can add it to list3.\n5.

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of sets in Python.\n3. Sets in Python store multiple items in a single variable.\n4.
