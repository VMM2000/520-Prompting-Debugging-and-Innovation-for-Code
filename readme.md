### Workflow 
To see my workflow checkout the included jupiter Notebook.
It contains all scripts used to generate the code and data for these exercises.
Additionally I used the first 10 problems of CodeScore-MBPP-ET-dataset. 
Check out [this](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dz1/CodeScore-MBPP-ET) for references.
To recreate the results run the jupiter Notebook (preferably in GoogleColab)

### Results
